# Shelpin

# Hi!!! 

My name is [Alex Casas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexblockchain/), and I have been working in this baby for two years, since I left the corporate world to create Shelpin, in my mind more than 15 years ago as a personal duty. 

I am not a dev, I am an “ex-infiltrated bizman" , and now that a little but strong community is built, and that I have been learning, knowing people , exploring different models and technologies,  it is time for the buidling of the platform, and because of the project and personal philosophy, this awesome Blockternship initiative is the perfect place to start making wellfare recirculate.

# Overview

* Brands wants to build emotional links with their customers to compete. Philantropy is cool for them. 

* Customers wants to feel better by purchasing good and services perceived as socially responsible by them. 

* The market of gaining and maintaining clients is worth 582 Bn USD , only in advertisement.

* 0.7 % of world household consumption equals to the amount money needed to end up hunger, take fresh water to every human being and have every HIV infected people properly treated. (data crunched from the World Bank database and NGO publicly available info).

* Does not make sense to establish individual social contracts brand-consumer that grants the loyalty of a client in exchange for a % give back to change makers of the consumer preference? 

* That is only possible if every slice of the process is completely traceable, accountable, auditable, transparent, measurable…sound familiar??? 

The current issue proposes to develop the MVP of the platform that will inject Giveth dac´s funds from the brands we are going to involve though the starting of the “Re-evolution of customers movement” *. 

This issue aims at becoming a “funds plug-in” software for Giveth DAC´s , that also can act as an incentive to onboard changemakers to Giveth as an alternative and free source of funds for them, is offered.

You can see here a little home-made video.

# Philosophy

I am an an early member of the Giveth community precisely because of philosophy. Shelpin aims not only to be open source software but an open source business model for social good. 

Why you can make Pp2 reviewing to some piece of software and not to a financial plan, or a product development, CRM strategy, or support procedures, based on the voluntary and fairly rewarded contributions of people that shares the mission? 

Why to keep all the profits of your social impact business model when you can share them make it bigger faster and deliver real change in a global scope?

There are also two philosophical factors that have a lot to do with having been working two years in the community, research, learning, evangelizing side, and not having an MVP ready.  

Shelpin does not accept traditional investment neither work for free or in exchange of promises, even though some people has offered both, when you try to play the game differently you gotta take unpaved paths. 

# Next steps

## Proposed MVP mainly consisting in : 

* Desktop implementation based in [Brave open source browser](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop) and account creation and PK management system based on [EDGE SECURE](https://github.com/EdgeApp/edge-core-js). (highly recommended to have look guys and ladies for other projects) 

* Issuance and allocation of the tokens to the user when transacting in e-commerce sites through the MVP app. Each brand has a predefined % of purchase donation, tokens are generated at a 1:1 ratio to the FIAT donated. 

* Those tokens are a representation of value of that fiat money and binds the donor brand to donate that fiat when milestones are approved. 

* Adaptation of brave wallet to whitelist addresses owned by NGO´s so tokens can only be sent to those charities.
 
* Donor brand visual alerts: when searching in engines , after a query of the url results in a Shelpin associates database, the app will “draw” a Shelpin heart aside those results that are Shelpin associates and will donate for their purchase. 

* Integration with Giveth DAC´s and simple dashboard / admin panel for users (brands and ngo´s dashboard could wait).

Clearly this is a Giveth flavoured project but production outputs will be immediately added to Status .

After the completion of the MVP, a very special donation crowdfunding will happen ;) to complete the whole platform and fund the global expansion of Shelpin DAO to become a global welfare recirculation machine to balance our society.

Completely available to answer any questions and give every information you might need or want. There is a lot to tell but I wanted to keep this short. 

Currently working on the third iteration of the website, definitive HopePaper, Governance and transparency model, Re-evolution of customers action, and the implementation of Shelpin DAO as open social impact business model amongst other crazy ideas. 

Shelpin itself is an experiment but I can´t help seeing the result. Do you wanna play together??? ;)))   


# NOTE

For the sake of transparency and fair play regarding the current application and its requirements compliance regarding point two “ Be built on Ethereum blockchain” 

Even if the current chosen language to develop Shelpin platform is Solidity, it is very likely that in a production scenario cost of txs obliges to migrate to RSK drivechain to ensure economic viability of the model even though still could be run on the Ethereum public network  


* Re-evolution of customers hint: 
Do you imagine thousands of people massively calling their favourite brands asking for funds for their preferred NGO´s ,  through a very nice and funny automated web-callcenter platform ;) ?
